# Lantern

A prototype [Data Catalogue](https://data.bas.ac.uk/-/index) for BAS discovery metadata.

## Overview

The BAS Data Catalogue is a data discovery tool used to find, evaluate and access resources produced, managed and/or used
by the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk) and [UK Polar Data Centre](https://www.bas.ac.uk/data/uk-pdc/).
This includes datasets, products (maps), services and other information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is temporary to formalise and build out refactored components initially developed in the
> [BAS Assets Tracking Service](https://github.com/antarctica/assets-tracking-service) that will form the next release
> of the [ADD Metadata Toolbox üõ°Ô∏è](https://gitlab.data.bas.ac.uk/MAGIC/add-metadata-toolbox), which will form the new
> BAS Data Catalogue.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is focused on needs within the British Antarctic Survey. It has been open-sourced in case parts are of
> interest to others. Some resources, indicated with a 'üõ°' or 'üîí' symbol, can only be accessed by BAS staff or
> project members respectively. Contact the [Project Maintainer](#project-maintainer) to request access.
